# Real-Estate-Property-Investment-Project
This project has a property investment analysis of 6633 Avenue M, Brooklyn, NY 11234. The project focuses on the purchase, renovation, and financial performance of a three-family property listed at $1,050,000, located on a corner lot. The property includes 7 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms across two 3-bedroom, 1.5-bath apartments and one 1-bedroom apartment, with a total living space of 3,152 sqft.
Key features of the analysis include the propertyâ€™s purchase price, renovation costs, cash investment requirements, and an expansion opportunity through the addition of a studio unit. The financial breakdown covers rent rolls, monthly expenses, and a sensitivity analysis for Net Operating Income (NOI) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) projections. Quantitative analysis shows an IRR of 7.75% after a 5-year hold period, with an 8% preferred return for limited partners and a 50% profit distribution after the preferred return.
Additionally, the project explores development opportunities by converting extra space into a studio with a basement and remodeling the existing units. The analysis highlights the potential for strong returns, low vacancy rates, and risk mitigation through a 60-day renovation period. Overall, this project demonstrates the profitability of investing in the 6633 Avenue M property through detailed financial modeling and development strategies.
